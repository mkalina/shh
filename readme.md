What is Shh?
============

An AppleScript or [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com/) Extension to close Twitter, Skype, iChat, Mail (so far) so that you can get to work.

Installation
----------------

To install Shh in Alfred simply double click on the extension file: alfred/shh.alfredextension

Otherwise, you can run the AppleScript anyway you'd like.

Contribute
----------------

Doubtless there are many noisy applications that we all should close from time-to-time to get our work done. Feel free to add as many applications to this script as you'd like and contribute back to the GitHub repository.
